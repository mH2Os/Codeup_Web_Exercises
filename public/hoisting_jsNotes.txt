Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.
If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).
To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
